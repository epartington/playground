# playground

This repo contains a variety of stuff. Mostly it's place to store snippets of things. Maybe someone asked "how can I do x with y?", and so I wrote an example script, playbook or something else. Maybe I myself wanted to test if I can achieve x with y. Testing with GitHub specifics like Actions too. So it'll be random stuff, some tested and some just proving concepts. Don't be surprised if things are broken, there is no claim of anything being fully tested or maintained here.
