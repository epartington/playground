# playground

This repo contains a variety of stuff. Mostly it's place to store snippets of things. Maybe someone asked "how can I do x with y?" and I wrote an example script or playbook. Maybe I myself wanted to test if I can achieve x with y. So it'll be random stuff, some tested and some just proving concepts. Don't be surprised if things are broken, there is no claim of anything being fully tested or maintained here.
