# playground

This repo contains a variety of stuff. Mostly it's place to store snippets of things. Maybe someone asked "how can I do x with y?" and I wrote an example script of playbook. Maybe I wanted to test myself if I can achieve x with y. So it'll be random bits and bobs, don't expect much more than that in here...
