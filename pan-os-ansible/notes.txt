Create a host_<hostname> file in host_vars for each potential host, include IP address and creds, and values for variables
Create inventory.txt, just a plain-text list of hosts in host_<hostname> format
Use this to execute a playbook against a specific host:
    ansible-playbook playbook.yml -e target="host_firewall01"

When using pyenv:
 /Users/jholland/.pyenv/versions/3.10.4/bin/python -m pip install -U -r ../requirements.txt
